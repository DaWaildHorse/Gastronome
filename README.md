# Gastronome

This project is a web-based platform that suggests recipes based on ingredients detected through image recognition. Using an artificial intelligence model, users can upload photos of food and receive personalized recipe suggestions tailored to their dietary restrictions and culinary preferences. 

The main goal is to promote creative and sustainable cooking, reduce food waste, and support people with diverse lifestyles. 

The system is designed to be accessible, inclusive, and scalable â€” with future potential for integration into mobile apps, smart kitchen devices, and nutritional tracking tools.
